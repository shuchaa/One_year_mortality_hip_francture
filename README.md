# Manual and automatic investigation of machine learning and deep learning models in predicting one-year mortality in elderly patients with hip fracture

### Purpose: Hip fractures in elderly patients are associated with a relatively high mortality rate. Accurate prediction of one-year mortality could enable clinicians to implement targeted interventions and potentially improve patient outcomes. This study examines the performance of various machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models in predicting one-year mortality among elderly patients with hip fracture.
### Methods: We utilized a database of 2,604 elderly patients with hip fractures from our institution.  Each patient had 98 clinical parameters, and the outcome of interest was one-year mortality (binary). A total of seven ML models and three DL models were developed and evaluated. We also conducted explainability analyses using feature importance metrics and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values to gain insight into model decision-making. In addition, we explored a combined large language model (LLM) and automated ML framework to determine whether such a system could produce comparable predictive performance with minimal specialized expertise.
### Results: Out of the ten ML and DL models tested, the XGBoost model showed the highest performance with an AUC-ROC of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.88â€“0.90) in the training set and 0.85 in the test set. Notably, the automated ML-based model achieved statistically comparable performance to XGBoost, indicating that powerful predictive models can be developed without extensive technical knowledge.

### Conclusion: ML models, including those generated through automated frameworks, can offer valuable decision support for clinicians managing elderly patients with hip fractures. By accurately identifying patients at high risk for one-year mortality, healthcare teams can tailor perioperative care and post-discharge follow-up strategies to potentially improve survival outcomes.
